# 2x2x2-RubixCubeSolver

## Explanation
 - **Solves the 2x2x2 Rubik's mini-cube using Prolog**
 - **Firstly, the program will have a "Solved State" to compare the scrambled state that the program is given** 
 - **Using the scrambled Rubix cube given, using the BFS(Breadth-first search) algorithm to solve the cube level by level until it reaches the "Solved State"**
 - **It will then extract all solutions and output the most efficient solution path possible**
## Features
 - **Solver is trackable so it can backtrack through all shortest solutions**
 - **Uses the meet-in-the-middle strategy to produce the shortest solutions possible**
   
## Technologies Used 
 - **Prolog**
 - **BFS Algorithm**
